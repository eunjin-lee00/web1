      <p>
        A computer programmer, sometimes called a software developer,
        a programmer or more recently a coder (especially in more informal contexts),
         is a person who creates computer software.
        The term computer programmer can refer to a specialist in one area of computers,
        or to a generalist who writes code for many kinds of software. </p>
  <p>
  A programmer's most oft-used computer language (e.g., Assembly, COBOL, C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Lisp, Python)
  may be prefixed to the term programmer. Some who work with web programming languages also prefix their titles with web.
